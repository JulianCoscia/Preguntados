# 🤔 Trivia Game for School Gameday Event at E.S.S N°3 🎉

### 🔍 Project Overview
This project was designed for the students of Medanos High School ("E.S.S N°3") for their annual school gameday event. During this event, students are divided into eight tribes, each represented by a color, and compete in different games. Points are awarded based on performance, and the tribe with the highest points wins.

One of the main games in the event is a trivia competition called "Preguntados," where teams of three members from each tribe compete against each other. The students asked me to help create a new version of this trivia game, and I gladly accepted to collaborate on this special event.

### ✨ Features
This trivia game currently supports:
- **8 Teams**: Represented with color, name and score earned.
- **Customizable Questions**: Supports unlimited questions with up to four answer options per question.
- **Timed Rounds**: Each team has 45 seconds to answer, scoring points for correct responses.
- **Built-in Questions**: Currently loaded with 120 questions, split with 15 unique questions per team.

### 🔧 Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Team & Question Management**: Adding flexibility for users to easily add or delete teams, questions, and answer options through a user-friendly interface.
- **Code Improvements**: Focusing on improving code efficiency, security, robustness, and documentation.
- **Navigation System**: Developing a system for navigating between questions, allowing users to select specific questions to play.
- **Randomizer for Fairness**: Implementing a randomizer to mix questions and teams for a fairer game experience.
- **Timer Controls**: Adding pause and play buttons to better control the timing for each question.
- **Configuration Window**: Enabling more customization options to make the game more user-friendly.
- **Design Variety**: Including multiple backgrounds, bars, options, and question graphics for a more personalized experience.
- **User Manual**: Providing an installation, configuration and how to play guide.
- **Music Integration**: Adding background music and sound effects.

### 🎯 Project Vision
My goal is to create a well-designed, customizable, and easy-to-use trivia game that I can gift to the school as a tool for future events. This way, they can use it every year at the school gameday event without needing my help. (They asked me for a trivia game this year and have done so in past years, during which I developed an older version of this game.)
